<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">
<p>
People live and die every day on the basis of moral decisions made by
others. <a href="https://drugabuse.com/contingency-management/">Contingency Management</a> (to name one example) is an effective
method for managing drug addiction which is not widely used in the
United States because of the perception of a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/27/health/addiction-treatment-pays-drug-users-to-stay-clean.html">moral hazard</a>.
</p>

<p>
Moral issues are not limited to minor adjustments in treatment
practices either: at various moments in the history of human beings
radical acts of creation and destruction have been precipitated by
acts of moral theorizing. The French Revolution, The Genocide of the
Jews and other peoples in Nazi Germany, Soviet Gulags and America's
own for profit prison and jail system (where, in some places, Sheriffs
get to keep any money they don't use to feed inmates) have had a
genuine, powerful, destructive effect on human beings.
</p>

<p>
Things aren't always negative. Civil Rights movements in the mid to
late period of the last century were successful, after much struggle,
in mitigating many of the negative effects of deeply corrupt systems.
</p>

<p>
The critical point is that moral judgements were at the heart of all
these events.

<h2 id="org56288e4"><span class="section-number-2">2</span> Moral Philosophy</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
Most people do not entertain serious thought about their moral
philosophy. When we pick up our moral intuitions from religion or
culture, they are more or less passively received. And yet most of us
have the capacity for moral disgust, though it isn't obvious to me
that our instinctual intuitions are any more effective at perceiving
moral circumstances than our brains are.
</p>

<p>
Good Books:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>JL Mackie's Ethics</li>
<li>Peter Singer's Practical Ethics</li>
<li>Rachels and Rachels' The Elements of Moral Philosophy</li>
</ol>

<p>
I enjoy the work of Martha Nussbaum.
</p>

<p>
Luckily we don't need much by way of moral philosophy to appreciate
the ethical implications of data science.

<h2 id="org11be19d"><span class="section-number-2">3</span> The Belmont Report</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
Soft homework: read the <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/belmont-report/index.html">Belmont Report</a>.
</p>

<p>
From the website: "The Belmont Report was written by the National
Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and
Behavioral Research. The Commission, created as a result of the
National Research Act of 1974, was charged with identifying the
basic ethical principles that should underlie the conduct of
biomedical and behavioral research involving human subjects and
developing guidelines to assure that such research is conducted in
accordance with those principles. Informed by monthly discussions
that spanned nearly four years and an intensive four days of
deliberation in 1976, the Commission published the Belmont Report,
which identifies basic ethical principles and guidelines that
address ethical issues arising from the conduct of research with
human subjects."
</p>

<p>
The history of unethical medical research is grim indeed and I will
highlight only one case: the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tuskegee/timeline.htm">USPHS Syphilis Study at Tuskegee</a>
experiment in which the US Public Health Services allowed around 300
black men to go untreated for Syphilis despite an existing effective
treatment to study the progression of the disease, despite the fact
that there was no compelling reason to collect such data.
</p>

<p>
Incidents like this lead to the development of the Belmont Report
and subsequent legislation and conventions.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, this level of scrutiniy is rarely applied to
contemporary data science.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgb108527" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgb108527"><span class="section-number-2">4</span> Responsibilities</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
Data Scientists have two primary moral responsibilities (in my
opinion). They are related. I tend to conceptualize these issues in
terms of explicit and implicit contracts.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org8606edb" class="outline-3">

<h4 id="org1b727ad"><span class="section-number-4">4.1.1</span> Social Contracts</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4-1-1">
<p>
One of the marvellous things about the contemporary world is that
society sets aside a fairly large amount of treasure to support a
class of citizens whose only responsibility is the pursuit of various
forms of truth.
</p>

<p>
A wonderful book of philosophy, "The Grasshopper" by Bernard Suits,
defines a game as "Any activity that involves the voluntary pursuit of
a goal by less than efficient means." A good argument can be made that
mathematics fits this definition - and yet we set aside money each
year for thousands of mathematicians to play mathematical games.
</p>

<p>
The implicit contract between an academic and society is thus that the
academic pursues and reports on the pursuit of truth. 
</p>

<p>
If you work in the private sector as a statistician or a data
scientist, you are being paid to say true things about the data you
analyze.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org87a65b5" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org87a65b5"><span class="section-number-4">4.1.2</span> Fudging Data Explicitly</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4-1-2">
<p>
At the same time, our society is almost entirely based on
incentives. And thus I can virtually guarantee that you will
encounter, at some point in your lives, if not already, a circumstance
in which you will feel pressure to aver something as true when you
don't have adequate evidence.
</p>

<p>
The trouble is that we are often rewarded for positive results rather
that correct results. New, positive, results are much more publishable
than old confirmations or disconfirmations. 
</p>

<p>
The best advice I can give you here is learn to identify lost causes
quickly so that you can cut your losses. Also learn to publish
negative results. Consider journals which exist entirely for that
purpose, like <a href="https://www.negative-results.org/">"The Journal of Negative Results."</a> or <a href="https://jnrbm.biomedcentral.com/">"The Journal of
Negative Results in BioMedicine."</a>
</p>

<p>
One benefit of academia is that you can usually count on your
colleagues to find and criticize incorrect results and thus, despite
publish or perish, there are serious long term career consequences to
bad science.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org2d4bc0c" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org2d4bc0c"><span class="section-number-4">4.1.3</span> The Private Sector</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4-1-3">
<p>
In the private sector, on the other hand, you will face both a
pressure to report a positive result and a wild willingness to
interpret your results positively if doing so will advance a project
upon which someone has staked political capital.
</p>

<p>
Unlike the working as an academic, data scientists are unlikely to
stay at one job for more than five years, and the results of their
previous work are not generally publicly available. Thus, it is much
easier to pass off bad results as good ones and assume that when things
eventually do go wrong you'll be long gone.
</p>

<p>
The best way to avoid this pressure is to learn to forcefully and
accurately present correct results, no matter the political
implications.
</p>

<p>
Also, learn to resist pushes to go back to the drawing board without
new data.

The cautionary tale of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Wansink#Retractions_and_corrections">Brian Wansink</a>.
</p>

<p>
Here is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170312041524/http://www.brianwansink.com/phd-advice/the-grad-student-who-never-said-no">the post</a> and an exerpt:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
    qWhen she arrived, I gave her a data set of a self-funded, failed study
which had null results (it was a one month study in an all-you-can-eat
Italian restaurant buffet where we had charged some people ½ as much
as others).  I said, "This cost us a lot of time and our own money to
collect.  There's got to be something here we can salvage because it's
a cool (rich &amp; unique) data set."  I had three ideas for potential
Plan B, C, &amp; D directions (since Plan A had failed).  I told her what
the analyses should be and what the tables should look like.  I then
asked her if she wanted to do them.
</p>

<p>
Every day she came back with puzzling new results, and every day we
would scratch our heads, ask "Why," and come up with another way to
reanalyze the data with yet another set of plausible hypotheses.
Eventually we started discovering solutions that held up regardless of
how we pressure-tested them.  I outlined the first paper, and she
wrote it up, and every day for a month I told her how to rewrite it
and she did.  This happened with a second paper, and then a third
paper (which was one that was based on her own discovery while digging
through the data).
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Literally modifying data or overstating positive results is clearly
unethical. This is what we used to call a sin of commission back in
Catholic School: you know what you are up to and you should feel bad
about it.
</p>

<p>
A much more insidious form of Academic Fraud corresponds to sins of
omission, where you report results which would not stand up to due
diligence.

</ol>

<p>
It is tempting to view data science as a "fishing expedition" in which
we get a data set and we dig into it until such a time as we find a
good result.
</p>

<p>
But we know from our model characterization lessons that even the
simplest sort of modeling exercise depends on a number of choices
like:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>How we eliminate outliers</li>
<li>How we define categorical variables from continua</li>
<li>What variables we choose to include in our model</li>
<li>How we perform our train and test split</li>
<li>What methods we choose to apply (eg, logistic regression vs linear
discriminant analysis vs gradient boosted regression)</li>
</ol>

<p>
With enough such decisions we can, consciously or subconsciously, pick
out a sequence of events which leads to a positive result which, if
the analysis we're repeated with newly collected data, might not be
repeatable.

<h4 id="org8332a79"><span class="section-number-4">4.1.5</span> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preregistration_(science)">Pre-registration</a></h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4-1-5">
<p>
One solution to this problem is "pre-registration". When studies are
pre-registered the researcher designs a research plan before the data
is even in their hands. Thus it cannot be tailored either consciously
or subconsciously to produce a positive result - a spurious positive
result in this case is a genuine statistical fluke.
</p>

<p>
Many Journals support pre-registration these days. Consider using
them. Careers have been ruined by p-hacking. Pre-registration makes
your short term job harder but will give you a more robust long term
career.

Even if you aren't publishing in a journal, consider informal
pre-registration. Design your research plans ahead of time, Post them
on your blog or share them with your manager. Get comfortable
explaining what a p-value is so that stake holders can understand the
issues. Don't wait to do this.

<p>
At the very least you must maintain a careful record of your research
decisions. Hence the emphasis on small, well documented, commits and a
clean git history. Think of this as post-registration: you have a
comprehensive record of all the things you have tried. If your source
code is available online, then anyone can see your research
history. This might help keep you honest.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-2">
<p>
This is a tricky one to discuss because there isn't all that much
agreement on precisely what obligations we have to
society. Unfortunately, from my point of view, if you work in the
private sector you will inevitable encounter people who believe that
their social obligations are minimal or are met entirely by the
pursuit of their own self interest. 
</p>

<p>
It isn't my place to make a comprehensive case for a more cooperative
conception of your role in the world but I will point out that most
human beings, even those who claim otherwise, fail spectacularly to
demonstrate, at an intuitive level, the moral intuitions suggested by
the hardest nosed Randian Libertarian.
</p>

<p>
The philosopher Peter Singer makes this kind of practical moral
argument <a href="https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-3-319-16999-6_444-1?page=5">quite easily</a>, though I disagree with some broad elements of
his philosophy.
</p>

<p>
In any case, I want to encourage you to consider the implicit
contracts that people enter into constantly in order to function in
the world.

<h4 id="org4977ff3"><span class="section-number-4">4.2.1</span> Case Study : Metering</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4-2-1">
<p>
Most of us are familiar with the idea of metering services. For
instance: water. We get a bill at the end of the month which reflects
how much water we've used. Explicitly or implicitly we have some
understanding about this process. When I was a kid, a person came to
our house once or twice a month to read the digits on the meter and
these numbers would inform the bill.
</p>

<p>
Most people still think of their water meter as primarily <span class="underline">metering</span>. 
</p>

<p>
However, contemporary smart meters record water usage at an hourly or
even quarter hourly rate and the data may be collected and stored
forever by the water company or even third parties. 
</p>

<p>
Things really get interesting when you consider the possibility of
disaggregating the data.
</p>



<div id="org9fbec8a" class="figure">
<p><img src="./images/meter_disag.jpg" alt="meter_disag.jpg" />
</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 1: </span>Meter Disaggregation uses a model to convert a string of consumption values to usages by different appliances.</p>
</div>

<p>
It turns out disaggregating water data is very difficult because the
temporal resolution of the recordings are typically much too low to be
appropriate for the algorithms that work.
</p>

<p>
Disaggregation is often portrayed as beneficial to the end user:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>It might allow them to understand how they use their resources</li>
<li>It can detect leaks or otherwise malfunctioning devices</li>
</ol>

<p>
But it is also a pretty big invasion of your privacy. Its easy to come
up with salacious ways this data might be employed: maybe someone's
wife is away for the weekend but the monthly disaggregation report
shows an unusual number of showers at the house for the same time
period. 
</p>

<p>
But its also not too hard to think of less nice possibilities: a
dissident living in a repressive regime might be exposed because water
usage peaks during the weekends, when they host meetings to organize
anti-government actions.
</p>

<p>
I would argue that even when a company or researcher has access to
data, if the data was collected under a set of presumptions held by
the user, then analysis should be restricted to those assumptions.
</p>

<p>
You may find it difficult to resist the pressure to break this rule in
practice.

<h4 id="org44d93e9"><span class="section-number-4">4.2.2</span> Case Study: Racial Bias in Facial Recognition</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4-2-2">
<p>
Facial Recognition is big business and sadly its already being applied
in many places. 
</p>

<p>
I admit, even I was surprised when I saw this demo:
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://www.hownormalami.eu/">How Normal Am I</a>
</p>

<p>
Facial Recognition Tech sucks, however. Its not that it can't
recognize faces, it is that it is racially and gender biased in how
false positives and false negatives are distributed.
</p>

<p>
Luckily the government isn't entirely asleep at the wheel:
</p>

<p>
From <a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2019/NIST.IR.8280.pdf">Face Recognition Vendor Test (FRVT)Part 3: Demographic Effects Patrick Grother, Mei Ngan, Kayee Hanaoka</a>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
False positives:Using the higher quality Application photos, false
positive rates are highest in West and East African and East Asian
people, and lowest in Eastern European individuals.  This effect is
generally large, with a factor of 100 more false positives between
countries.  However, with a number of algorithms developed in China
this effect is reversed, with low false positive rates on East Asian
faces.  With domestic law enforcement images, the highest false
positives are in American Indians, with elevated rates in African
American and Asian populations; the relative ordering depends on sex
and varies with algorithm. 
</p>

<p>
We found false positives to be higher in
women than men, and this is consistent across algorithms and
datasets. This effect is smaller than that due to race.
</p>

<p>
We found elevated false positives in the elderly and in children; the
effects were larger in the oldest and youngest, and smallest in
middle-aged adults"
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
But these technologies are still actively being pitched. 
</p>

<p>
In the US a run in with the police can be deadly.
</p>

<p>
So the lesson here is: "Don't try to sell some data analysis unless
you really understand the biases involved and even then, ask yourself
if the world would really be a better place if it were out in the
world."
</p>

<p>
In fact, there are many questions you should ask yourself during the
development of a <a href="https://theconvivialsociety.substack.com/p/the-questions-concerning-technology">new technology</a>, including the development of a model.
</p>

<p>
My take would be your time would be better spent contacting your
representatives to ban this technology.
</p>

<p>
But why is it that these technologies have such a predictable bias in
favor of the majority population? It all comes down to training data,
which itself often contains biases. In the case of facial recognition
the issue appears to be <span class="underline">less</span> training data for non-majority faces
and thus a higher than expected rate of error for non-majority faces.
</p>

<p>
As we have learned even in the simple examples we used for model
characterization and validation, models require a great deal of
subjective adjustment of hyperparameters and it is in these
adjustments that bias can manifest.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
<p>
It is your job to tell people the truth to the best of your ability,
including tricky ideas like uncertainty therein.
</p>

<p>
The challenges here are manifold: 
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>It is hard to figure out what is true.</li>
<li>It is hard to explain uncertainty to lay stakeholders</li>
<li>There are political pressures for positive results in both academia
and the private sector, though of different forms</li>
<li>Data Science is rarely as neutral as it looks because it often
relies on training data of dubious quality.</li>
</ol>

<p>
I think the best ethical advice I can give you is to compartmentalize
yourself as a data/scientist. You might be seeking funding for your
startup as its founder, but when you are operating as the data
scientist, stick stricly to that role, no matter how much investors
want to see a miracle. This is really the only way to meet your long
term explicit and implicit obligations.
