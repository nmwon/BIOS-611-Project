* Grading


The students should submit a screenshot of an Rstudio server
running. In the terminal they should have a string like:

```
<onyen> e1b058728f00f6009214ab70fbf9c20d -
```

The precise set of numbers is determined by their Onyen. You can check
it by calculating the md5sum of the following string:

```
<onyen>@longleaf.unc.edu:/nas/longleaf/home/<onyen> /home/<onyen>/storage 
```

eg:

```
echo <onyen>@longleaf.unc.edu:/nas/longleaf/home/<onyen> /home/<onyen>/storage | md5sum
```

Should give you the result they post.

toups@longleaf.unc.edu:/nas/longleaf/home/toups /home/toups/storage
