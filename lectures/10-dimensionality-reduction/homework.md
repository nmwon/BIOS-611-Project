Homework
========

Consider the data file available at:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Vincent-Toups/datasci611/main/lectures/10-dimensionality-reduction/homework_data.csv

1. Perform a principal component analysis in R. How many components do
   you need to account for more than 90 percent of the variance in the
   data set?
   
2. Plot the first two components of the data. What can you say about
   the data from this picture?
   
3. For a data set this small we might do some due diligence. Plot each
   pair of coordinates in the original dataset against one
   another. Assuming we're looking for clusters in the data set, is
   there anything we might do to the data to make it easier to extract
   these clusters?
   
4. Modify you docker container to include sklearn and reticulate (you
   make copy the appropriate lines from the 611 Dockerfile). Perform a
   TSNE. Contrast the results with your insights from problems 1-4. 
   
5. Repeat the TSNE a few times. Do you get different results?
