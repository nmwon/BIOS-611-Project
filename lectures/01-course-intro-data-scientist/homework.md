Homework
========

1. Pick a data set you might find interesting.

2. Write a pitch for your analysis (~500 words). What do you hope to
learn by looking at it in detail?

3. Send me an email with 
   - a picture of your face
   - a phonetic pronunciation of your name
   - something interesting about you (or something boring)
   
Grading
=======

1. Give full credit if they have identified a data set and none otherwise.
2. Concentrate on the content of the pitch: do they have an
   interesting question? A good plan? Don't grade too harshly, since
   many students will have never analyzed data at all. Don't worry
   hard about grammar but feel free to correct it without penalty.
3. All or nothing.
